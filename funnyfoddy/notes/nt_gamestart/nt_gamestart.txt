first it shows the gamemaker studio splashscreen

then it has a pop-up saying something like
"playing the original before playing this fan game is recommended"
"would you like to play the 1985 classic Funny Game first?"
                          Yes >No

if you select yes you go in my remake of Funny Game
	when you're in funny game and make it to one of the ends it says
		"congrats on beating it! would you like to try for one of the other endings?"
		                          >yes >no
										selecting yes just loops the above
										selecting no sends you to the main menu*
	you can just quit it by selecting main menu/title in the pause menu*

if you select no it sends you straight to the main menu*

*before going to the main menu the screen goes black and has small
white text that says "you can select classic mode from the extras menu"


THE TITLE SCREEN IS:
recreation of Getting Over It's background but instead of a hammer wedged in
a rock, it's the pink guy. if you click continue, it does a backflip

your choices are layed out like

Exit                          Extra
                             (  ^ super small)









whatever option you have currently active will be in bold text
your options choices are layed out like
