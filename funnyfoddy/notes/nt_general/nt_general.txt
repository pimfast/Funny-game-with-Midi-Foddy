obj_checkpoint is where you respawn if you fall off the side. there is only one in the whole game
obj_coin is the thing you collect, it works exactly like how it did in the original Funny Game; all 19(NOTE: 19 IS VERY WRONG) coins = ending. 0 coins = special ending
obj_deathwall is different from how it worked before, instead of dying when you touch it you fall through all objects for like 2 seconds. (this can be used for a secret! (this is instead actually gonna be the botherwall idea))
obj_ground is just the ground. nothing special unless you touch obj_deathwall obviously
obj_player is you, physics and statistics are exactly the same as in Funny Game
