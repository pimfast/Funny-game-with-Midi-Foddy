jumping on blue blocks and collecting coins

jumping away from and towards bumpers

jumping onto moving platforms

...

purple walls have returned. and they work JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL D:

two ceilings of blue blocks that are positioned so that you cant fall 
through and then simply just left and right jumps while the gravity 
lightens up on you then it's gone entirely
and the appropriate ending sequence plays...

...unless of course you got a middle of the road amount of red squares
in which case the left and right jumps would still be happening
and the gravity would be lowering as you approached the top
but before you could escape the pull of the earth
a big-ass green ceiling blocks the way
after coming across this obstacle
the player goes ALL the way back down to the beginning
to find a Learn2Fly glider that must (somehow) be used to go up
super fast
LIKE WICKED FAST
with the "I Love College" music playing
to smash through the ceiling (with a cool fade to white effect)
and then a recreation/parody of the learn2fly cutscene plays
with the player replacing the penguin
